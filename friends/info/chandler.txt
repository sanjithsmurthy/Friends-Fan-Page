<h2>Character Analysis</h2>
<p>(Avoiding Spoilers)</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Grew up…</strong> in a sexually confusing household with his mother, an erotic novelist, and his father, a cross-dressing gay Las Vegas entertainer. No wonder he has trouble with women.</p>
<p><strong>Living…</strong> in Manhattan surrounded by his friends. An apartment renter, Chandler’s room location changes several times, but most often he shares a unit with his best friend Joey (and sometimes with a duck and a chick), across from Monica and Rachel. Chandler and Joey usually get on well as roommates, but sometimes Joey can take things overboard, like with his massive entertainment unit that blocked Chandler’s access to his bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Profession… </strong>working in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a multi-national corporation. It started as a temp job that, in typical Chandler fashion, seemed to become permanent without him fully realizing it. Even after many years, Chandler’s friends aren’t sure what he does, and he isn’t either. Though it definitely has something to do with WENUS: Weekly Estimated Net Usage System. Yes, it’s as exciting as it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Interests… </strong>using catchphrases (“Could that BE any more...” or “Oh, MY God”). Despite his dislike of excercise, Chandler makes an attempt to assimilate himself in sports culture - watching Knicks games every now and then and occasionally playing basketball and racquetball with Joey and Ross. In high school, he tried (and was rejected) from the figure skating team.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Status… </strong>hopelessly single, for the most part. His relationships tend to skew towards the “Is he really going out with her?” type. (Exhibit A: the screeching Janice.) However, once in a solid relationship, Chandler has demonstrated that not only can he be invested, but be capable of devotion and vulnerability. Too often, though, he lets his own insecurities and unease get in the way. As he even admits, “I’m hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!”</p>
<p><strong>Challenge…</strong> finding something that’s his that he can be proud of. Chandler’s generally embarrassed by his parents, his job, and his relationship status. His sense of humor helps him cope with all of these problems, but it won’t fix them. While Chandler prefers turning to unhealthy habits like smoking to deal with his issues, at some point he’s going to have to take something - or someone - seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Personality…</strong> funny, affable, sarcastic and a bit insecure. Chandler can always be counted on for a zinger or quip. As he put it, “I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable… I say more dumb things before 9 a.m. than most people say all day.” Things are always a little more entertaining when Chandler is around, although sometimes his spicy one-liners can be insensitive or annoying to his friends. He means well, though. Probably.</p>
